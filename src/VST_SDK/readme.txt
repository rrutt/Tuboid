If you obtained a VST 2 SDK developer's license from Steinberg Media
prior to October, 2018, you can copy the files aeffect.h and aeffectx.h 
from the VST2.4 sdk here.

These are the files you need:

    /vstsdk2.4/pluginterfaces/vst2.x/aeffect.h
    /vstsdk2.4/pluginterfaces/vst2.x/aeffectx.h
    
If you have copies of those files, 
you can build a VST 2 version of the Tuboid plugin.

Use the Tuboid-with-vst2.sln Visual Studio solution file
rather than the Tuboid.sln solution file.
